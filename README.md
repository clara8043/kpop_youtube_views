## Introduction
Predict the youtube video views of the K-pop group NCT using different types machine learning techniques to achieve the best model.

## Prospective
K-pop groups are becoming more and more famous globally. The groups themselves and their content creaters are working harder to fulfill 
their fans' needs. The data analysis of NCT's youtube data could give a visual understanding of which content people enjoy more.

## Reason for Data Selection
NCT is a K-pop group with three subgroups. Thus, they have four youtube accounts in total. This helps to generalize data to a wider audience of
K-pop fans. On top of this, because of the larger number of people in a regular K-pop
group, we can always find more reasons affecting youtube video views.

## Data Collection Process
* Created a Python script using GCP and Youtube API to collect 70 of the most recent videos and their statistics
* Added more features on top of the collected data that are important to the K-pop fan culture
